    "# 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Exploring Snowflake Data Science and ML Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this **Hands-on Lab**, where you'll get practical experience with some of Snowflake’s most powerful features for Data Science and Machine Learning development:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Snowflake Notebooks  \n",
    "Learn how to interactively explore, analyze, and visualize data using Snowflake Notebooks — an integrated development environment (IDE) right within the Snowflake UI. With support for Python and SQL side by side, Notebooks make it easier than ever to build, test, and document your data workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Snowflake Cortex ML Functions  \n",
    "Unlock the power of Snowflake Cortex, a fully managed machine learning service. You'll discover how to apply pre-built Cortex ML functions for tasks like classification, translation, task completion, and more — all without leaving the Snowflake environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Snowflake Model Registry  \n",
    "Take your ML projects to the next level with the **Model Registry**, which lets you manage and deploy custom models built inside or outside of Snowflake. You’ll learn how to register, version, and serve models, enabling seamless collaboration and production-ready deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Build and run interactive notebooks using Python and SQL  \n",
    "- Use Cortex ML functions to derive insights from raw data  \n",
    "- Register and deploy a custom machine learning model  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗓️ Lab Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the full cycle of building and operationalizing machine learning workflows directly in Snowflake. Below is the step-by-step agenda we'll follow:\n",
    "- 1️⃣ Data Sources Description  \n",
    "- 2️⃣ Data Visualization and Manipulation  \n",
    "- 3️⃣ Snowflake ML Capabilities  \n",
    "- 4️⃣ Snowflake Model Registry\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in and start building with AI in the Data Cloud! ☁️💡"
